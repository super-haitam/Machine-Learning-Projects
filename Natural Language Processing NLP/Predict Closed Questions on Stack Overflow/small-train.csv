**1. for-loop:**

**2. logical operator OR**

Both **solutions are slow**, aren't they?

    TABLE ids

... I could **use a join to make a really fast MySQL query**, right?

    $result = mysql_query(""SELECT a.ID, b.name FROM ids AS a JOIN personInfo AS b ON a.ID = b.ID"");

Is all this correct so far? If yes: Why is this so? The MySQL query is faster if I have a second table? With only one table it is incredibly slow? What is the fastest way to solve my problem (selecting the names matching the IDs of the PHP array)?",php,mysql,query,optimization,select,,open

I have found various ways to change the database connection including the following:

    reportDoc.DataSourceConnections[0].SetConnection(""server"", ""database"", ""user"", ""pwd"");
    reportDoc.ExportToDisk(CrystalDecisions.Shared.ExportFormatType.PortableDocFormat, path);

However, this always fails with the following error message.

> Failed to open the connection.

I have validated the connection parameters by successfully connecting to the database with pgAdmin III so I know the connection parameters are correct.  In addition, if I remove the SetConnection(...) line so the code looks like this:

    reportDoc.Load(report);
    reportDoc.ExportToDisk(CrystalDecisions.Shared.ExportFormatType.PortableDocFormat, path);

then the report runs fine using the connection parameters that are stored in the report.  Is it possible that this method does not work for ODBC connections?

I've created a TStringGrid with a set number of columns, and a variable number of rows (set at runtime).

When the user double clicks on any cell except for those in FixedRows and FixedCols, I add the contents of that cell to a list and remove that row. 

This is what I'm trying to do, but if the user has clicked on a cell in the FixedRow or FixedCol the contents of whatever non-fixed cell which happens to be selected are saved to the list. I'm using the .Col and .Row properties to detect the currently selected cell, but these only apply to non-fixed cells. 

Is there a way to check if the user has clicked on a FixedCell? 

PS. I know FixedRows and FixedCols are not selectable, but I'm looking for a way to ensure that a row is not removed by mistake if the user clicks on a Fixed cell by mistake.

Here's the code I'm using when the user double clicks on any cell.

So I'll just describe the problem and will then ask if the approach I am planning to take is generally right.

So what I have is a job board. There are job seekers that are stored in different tables and those tables have all kinds of relations. For example users and profiles tables are connected as 1-1. But then there is education table where user can insert any number of entries and that is 1-many. There is a bunch of such tables, they all are generally similar. But there is also resumes table that is one-many too (one user can have several resumes), it's main difference is that it holds actual resumes which leads to a rather big size of table.

Now what I need to do is build a resume search engine. Search form has all kinds of fields - minimum education, location, keywords, etc.. One important thing is that results should be grouped by user, so output format will be

    <matched user 1 (per search input such as min education)> <user's 1 matched resume 1, user's 1 matched resume 2, user's 1 matched resume 7 (per keywords)>
    <matched user 3> <user's 3 matched resume 10, user's 3 matched resume 123>

This all has to be ordered too, in this case user 1 goes first because he uploaded resume recently.

And in this place it gets extreme. Now we take these selected and grouped results and group them again because we want to have search filters, which is similar to what indeed has 
http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=php&l=NYC%2C+NY
(check on the left where it offers you to select for example Manhattan, NY jobs only). And we also want to count that (just like indeed).

What I started doing is some denormalization. For example I already store an additional field with concatenated location - City, State. And then group by that field instead of concat-ing city and state on the fly. Then I also tried to get rid of some 1-X relations, for example instead of joining and going through all education entries, I pre-calculate and store user's highest degree. And of course I added indexes. This did make things dramatically faster but everything is still so so slow.

So my question is how do I normally handle such situation. Is it slow because I messed up normalization and indexing somewhere? Or do such queries/structures doomed to be slow and the ultimate solution is to completely denormalize this into a single resumes table. If latter, my other concern is the size of resumes table if I push there all the data that is being searched and grouped on. That table already holds resume texts that have full-text search done over them and this denormalization will probably make the table huge. Won't that make queries slow again?",mysql,database,query-optimization,database-optimization,,,open

So I found the dll under:

C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETFramework\v3.5\Profile\Client

I decided to try and set a reference directly to this 3.5 dll. After doing this, my project ended up with a 2.0 version.

What is going on? I thought that if an app was compiled against a particular version of the Framework, that all of the dlls that were part of the framework were all from the same version. It seems like I am mixing versions. I guess I am not too surprised that I can simultaneously access dlls from older versions of the framework, but if there is a newer version in the 3.5 folder, why is it not using it? or is this really the 2.0 dll placed in the 3.5 folder?

I'm an empiric website programmer, so rest assured I always try till the wee hours of dawn to work ways around the lack of proper instruction. That's when Stack Overflow comes in real handy. But, this time, I've been hitting my head against a PHP wall for over three or four days. So I'm asking out for some aid on the matter.

Now, programming is purely math, in essence. Which is why one can eventually understand its language and what's going on. I reached the point of being a very experienced AS programmer and then I decided to switch from Flash, try my hand at HTML using JS and jQuery (the competition, so to speak) and fell in love. Still, am rather an amateur in that field. But my relationship to PHP in particular is of a completely different sort: I don't understand it and have no patience for it; it's Sanskrit to me. Maybe I haven't used it enough to get the hang of it, but it seems not to make logical sense to me, as JS and HTML and AS and ETC. do.

**Anyway, my predicament:**

I've built a custom **Shoutbox** based on the great code given here: [http://yensdesign.com/2009/01/create-a-shoutbox-using-php-and-ajax-jquery/][1]. However, the code doesn't include a captcha, which makes it completely vulnerable to SPAM. So I first designed a simple captcha consisting of various images that contain numbers, all adding up to a specific number. Now I'm trying to go fancy and I've been trying to add **Google reCaptcha**.

ReCaptcha is PHP-based. The Sbox does use PHP but once a JS file does the checking-of-the-form stuff; it uses PHP to finally save the data entered in a mySql database and retrieve previously saved data to be displayed. I've tried putting the reCaptcha PHP code in this part of the process, but it doesn't really work, as all it does is stop the data from being entered and stop it from being retrieved. What I need is something which stops the process at the beginning, as by saying: ""Hey! You've entered the wrong Captcha, you Spam-bot, you!""

I've also tried putting the PHP within the JS file. . . Finally, after pulling a great deal of hair, have come upon a sentence which says: ""JS is client-based; PHP is server-based."" Great info I could have come upon days ago. Amateur me, now I get why PHP is so fussy.

Anyway, I've tried placing PHP up and down and in an out and have gotten nil, naught, zero.


----------


I hope I've given enough background on the issue. Feedback on my first Stack Overflow question will be helpful. And especially helpful: any aid on cracking this mystery you can toss my way.

The reCaptcha PHP code is the following:

      <?php
  require_once('recaptchalib.php');<br>
  $privatekey = ""your_private_key"";<br>
  $resp = recaptcha_check_answer ($privatekey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$_SERVER[""REMOTE_ADDR""],<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$_POST[""recaptcha_challenge_field""],<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$_POST[""recaptcha_response_field""]);<br>

  if (!$resp->is_valid) {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// What happens when the CAPTCHA was entered incorrectly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die (""The reCAPTCHA wasn't entered correctly. Go back and try it again."" .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""(reCAPTCHA said: "" . $resp->error . "")"");<br>
  } else {<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Your code here to handle a successful verification<br>
  }<br>
  ?>

And that's about it on the reCaptcha, save for styling. Seems simple enough!

I think the Shoutbox codes are too many and too long to include here and saturate the post. But they're at link given above. They're basically the HTML Shoutbox, its JS file and the PHP info save & retrieve.

Also, for further reference on it, I'm attaching a link to a RAR-file containing my work on the Shoutbox, *as is*, to this point. As you will see, at the bottom of the page there's a preloader. It should turn off as a list of previous messages appears. It doesn't work because of the darned PHP I fumblingly placed inside the JS file--which no doubt is returning and error that stops the JS sequence. If you *comment* the PHP or delete it, then the sequence should be completed and at least a ""can't find db... bla bla"" message should appear as the preloader disappears, meaning the Shoutbox is functional (but without a captcha).

And the RAR-file, voilà: [http://alessandropucci.com/dload/sboxwcaptcha.rar][3].

In advance, thanks a lot for the patience and for any aid you can send my way!

However, here is my question in some details.
What is the best language to learn for an electrical/hardware engineer, if one needs the following capabilities:

1. Ease of access to the computer hardware in low level, for example easily be able to read from sound card buffers, etc.

2. The program can run very fast, so it is appropriate for real time applications.

3. It is easy to find a lot of mathematical, DSP, and access to hardware libraries.

4. It is easy to learn.

5. It is possible to create GUI relatively easily.

6. The main purpose of the software is to run on a Windows PC, not on smart phones.

7. It is something that will be around for a long time and will not be replaced with another language any time soon.

I've a wildcard domain pointing to /staging on my server, the folder looks something like this;

    /staging/**newproject**/  
    /staging/**newproject**/current/ **<-- this is a symlink to the latest release**  
    /staging/**newproject**/releases/  
    /staging/**newproject**/releases/20120612191029/ **<-- this is the latest release**  

    /staging/**anothernewproject**/  
    /staging/**anothernewproject**/current/ **<-- this is a symlink to the latest release**  
    .... and so on


Each of the project folder has its own .htaccess thing going on, it could be a magento, wordpress, cakephp etc installation which has been deployed by capistrano.

I want it so if i go to: http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/ it is re-written to show the content in that folders ""current"" directory for example;

http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/ would show /staging/newproject/current/ and  
http://anothernewproject.staging.mydomain.com/products would show /staging/anothernewproject/current/

Here is what i have tried already;

    RewriteEngine on
    Options +FollowSymLinks
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^([\w-]+)\.staging\.mydomain\.com$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %1/current/$1 [LAST,QSA]

Which kind of works but not as i would like, if i go to http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/ i get redirected to http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/newproject/current/

If i click to go through to a page i get http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/newproject/current/index.php/about-magento-demo-store
whereas what i want ideally is just http://newproject.staging.mydomain.com/index.php/about-magento-demo-store

Not sure if it is relevant but i am on a Media Temple dedicated virtual 4.0 box.

Could any one offer any tips on how to solve this? thanks in advance!

 - Registered users can buy the fixed

 - The list of all products is
   predefined by admin (5 fixed costs, 5

So it looks like simple auction or shopping cart with auction functionality. I don't care about the platform (but prefer php/lamp, ruby/ror, .net or java). Does anybody know any good open source solution which fits to my needs i described?

						thebox.hide();
						thebox.unload();
					}
					else{
						Boxy.alert(data.message);

I get no errors in IE7/IE8 just nothing happens when it calls the cp_module_lottery1ptentry_do() function.

I want to ask about explain query on MYSQL.

I have a table with myisam engine, about 150 million rows, 

then something is happening, i know myisam will lock entire database if something is happening, then i tried to find what query that locked my db.

i found that it was general query that supposed to be fast. 

    CREATE TABLE `post` (
    `postid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `threadid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    `username` varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `userid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    `title` varchar(250) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    `dateline` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    `pagetext` mediumtext NOT NULL,
    `visible` smallint(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    PRIMARY KEY (`postid`),
    KEY `userid` (`userid`),
    KEY `threadid` (`threadid`,`userid`),
    KEY `threadid_2` (`threadid`,`visible`)
    ) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=697557786 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 MAX_ROWS=2431504384     AVG_ROW_LENGTH=50 


then i found the query that takes too long to be returned ( about 300 s ).

i compare the query (explain) with another query.

When following the tutorial [Completing a Conversation in a Single Database][1].  Following the [Lesson 1][2], I have successfully created the message types, contract, the queues and services.  Following the [Lesson 2][3], I have probably sent the message.  However, when trying to receive the message, I get the NULL for the ReceivedRequestMsg instead of the sent content.

When looking at the `sys.transmission_queue`, the `transmission_status` for the message says:

> An exception occurred while enqueueing a message in the target queue. Error: 15517, State: 1. Cannot execute as the database principal because the principal ""dbo"" does not exist, this type of principal cannot be impersonated, or you do not have permission.

I have installed the SQL server using the Windows login like **Mycomp\Petr**.  I am using that login also for the lessons.

Can you guess what is the problem?  What should I check and or set to make it working?

This is how I've implemented it, but as you can see, it's a bit hackish:

my_partial.html:

    {% once mycontent %}
        this will only show once
    {% endonce%}

my_template.html:

    {% load my_tags %}
    {% for i in list %}
        {% my_partial %}
    {% endfor %}

my_tags.py:

    @register.inclusion_tag('my_partial.html',takes_context=True)
    def my_partial(context):
        return dict(arbitrary extra data)
    
    @register.tag(name=""once"")
    def do_once(parser, token):
        try:
            # Splitting by None == splitting by spaces.
            tag_name, var_name = token.contents.split(None, 1)
        except ValueError:
            raise template.TemplateSyntaxError(""%r tag requires arguments"" % token.contents.split()[0])
        nodelist = parser.parse(('endonce',))
        parser.delete_first_token()
        return DoOnceNode(nodelist, var_name)
    
    class DoOnceNode(template.Node):
        def __init__(self, nodelist, var_name):
            self.nodelist = nodelist
            self.var_name = '_do_once_'+var_name
        def render(self, context):
            request = context['request']
            
            # Make request.GET mutable.
            request.GET = dict(request.GET)
                
            if self.var_name in request.GET:
                return ''
            else:
                request.GET[self.var_name] = 1
                return self.nodelist.render(context)

Specifically, I'm using the request.GET dictionary as a mutable global scope. It's hackish and obviously not what the request object is designed to do, but it works.

Ideally, I'd like to use something like the context, but I found that it isn't shared between calls to this tag. i.e. `self.var_name in context` is always False, rendering it useless as a global scope.

Why isn't context shared the same way request is shared? Is there someway to make it truly shared, or is there some other object I can use to store globally accessible variables within a request?

      This is basically an agricultural project (web application).I need to design module where some calcuation takes place.
	  There are differnt crops invovled like maize,tomato,okra etc.Now each of these crops have different traits.
	  Each trait has a mesurament scale which lies in integer like 200-1000.now let say i have planted the crop and 
	  done measurement noted down the traits.Now i want to do some sort of measurement.Some measurements are simple and some are
	  complex.
	  
	  Lets take an example of crop maize.I have recored observations for 15 trait.(trait1.. trait15 are just alias the acutal name can be like plt_ht,yld)
	  trait1 trait2 trait3 trait4 trait5 trait6..... trait15
	  
	  i have recorded 5 observations for each traits
	  trait1         trait2          trait3    trait5 trait6..... trait15 
	  01,02,03,04     01,02,03,04   01,02,03,04
	  
	  User logs into system and selects his crops and  enters data for these observation i  either have to calculate average of those data entered for each  or sum of those.
	  This is simple but complexity comes when for some of the tratis i have some different formulas. Like lets take an example let say a trait YLD has a formula based on which i have to caluate its value which may  also depends on some other traits .This way  all differnet crops have different traits.All this i am able to do whenever user selects crop i will check for those specific traits and do calculations if it is not special trait then i eaither avg it or sum it based on db entery but there is lot of hard coding .I want to have some suggestion from you people if u can think of an better way of handling this.

I will ask a broad question to start-up my database architecture. 

Most probably, admins of the site will give me a negative point for this question but still I want to get some experienced databasers comments. 

The code I am writing is collecting data based on date. The application will collect data weekly, and each week stock prices will be stored into the database. 

There are several stocks, I want to store. For each store, I will save the price information. 

The **Stocks** table of my database  will be like this:

date - type of date
stock name - string
stock price - float
stock code - string ->unique key

The other table of the database will be **Market Table**
In this table, I will store 

stock code - string
stock country - string
stock market name- string

What is the best way to make such a database?

I need to compare prices of stocks based on date column. 

Should I create new tables for each date? or should I store them in a single table?

There are approximately 1200 stocks I need to store and follow up.

I will run my code each week and I wanna handle my data. 

thanks for your help. 

PS: please do not tell me to use another platform other than C# and do not offer any ready to made script. I want to write my own code.

I've got a perl script which I've tested from the command line and it works (outputs as desired.)

When I try to access said script from the browser, I get 404.

I've tried placing the script at:

* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/htdocs/mycgi.pl
* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl
* /Users/me/Sites/mydomain.com/htdocs/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl

and accessing it as:

* http://www.mydomain.com/mycgi.pl
* http://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/mycgi.pl

and all the various combinations, all to no avail (404.)

The script and its container directory have permissions 755.

So, what other steps am I missing?  Are there any good set-up guides?  I tried the MAMP-Pro manual, but it is filled with such information as ""the cancel button cancels the current operation"" and not really anything useful.  Google turned up several hits that all seem to talk about how to make this work on localhost, but I'm trying to serve this to the outside world.

Any hints?

none of which seems to have anything to do with the timecode. Note that the contents property is ""missing value""

If I try to get the current time of the movie it returns 0, even if the timecode doesn't start at 0.

As I said, it's not elegant -- But it works. Needless to say I welcome all recommendations how to write this better without using 1 class for each website method. Adding additional functionality or overall code management of each class is a daunting task.

The primary focus of my question: How to correctly use a background thread created by the Bluetooth Activity to continually transfer BluetoothData to the Plotting Activity's plotting method.

With Logcat I can deduce that my Bluetooth Activity has created some sort of background thread that continues to produce new BluetoothData even when I switch to my Plotting Activity.
 
I found the method in the background thread that writes the BluetoothData to Logcat. So I (foolishly?) used this method to call plotData() as a regular instance method as follows:

        PlottingActivity plottingActivity = new PlottingActivity();
        plottingActivity.plotData(BluetoothData);

NOTE: It doesn't work unless plotData() is a static method. But let's continue to talk about plotData() as a regular instance method as shown above.

Here's a problem: When plottingActivity is instantiated as above then its onCreate() method does **not** get called. Do I need to explicitly call onCreate() like I did plotData()? May not fix everything but seems like step in the right direction, no?

Furthermore, when the Bluetooth Activity is launched it does a number of things before the Plotting Activity is launched . Namely, the Bluetooth Activity sets up a background thread (as described above) which starts calling plotData() long before the Plotting Activity is launched with an Intent() and startActivity(). So I have to admit this seems wrong for me to be calling plotData() before the Plotting Activity is launched.

Closing questions:

1. How do I provide a mechanism for the Bluetooth background thread to detect if the Plotting Activity is active?
2. Discard/buffer all BluetoothData and do not call plotData() if the Plotting Activity is not active?
3. Call onCreate() before calling a regular instance of plotData()? Should I even be doing that?",android,multithreading,static,background,instance,06/06/2011 22:21:42,too localized

I know I can edit **/etc/hosts** to do this, but I'd like to avoid doing that.

To explicate, normally when you browse to `""http://admin.foo.com""`, it sends an HTTP request that looks something like this:

    GET / HTTP/1.0
    User-Agent: Wget/1.10.2 (well, it'd be Firefox, but you get the point)
    Accept: */*
    Host: admin.foo.com
    Connection: Keep-Alive

...and that request is sent to admin.foo.com's IP, which (let's say) is 10.0.0.1.  The ""Host"" header is extracted from the URL, and that header is what Apache uses to determine which virtual host to use.  If I put the IP address of admin.foo.com into Firefox, it sends the request to the right server, but the Host field has the IP address in it, and then Apache doesn't know what vhost to use, and defaults to using no vhost at all, which (in its config) causes a 403/Forbidden, so I can't navigate to the new server's IP to test this.

Again, I know I can use **/etc/hosts** for this, but I'd like to avoid doing so, and I figure Firefox must have some sekrit way to do this ;)

### Linux:

Currently we're using CGBitmapContextCreate and we access the memory buffer directly, then for each frame we call CGBitmapContextCreateImage, and then draw that bitmap to the screen. This is WAY too slow for full-screen refreshes on the iPad's retina display at a decent framerate (but it was okay for non-Retina-devices).

We've tried all kinds of OpenGL ES-based approaches, including the use of glTexImage2D and glTexSubImage2D (essentially rendering to a texture), but CPU usage is still high and we can't get more than ~30 FPS for full-screen refreshes on the iPad 3. The problem is that with 30 FPS, CPU usage is nearly at %100 just for copying the pixels to the screen, which means we don't have much to work with for our own rendering on the CPU.

We are open to using OpenGL or any iOS API that would give us maximum performance. The pixel data is formatted as a 32-bit-per-pixel RGBA data but we have some flexibility there...

Is there any way to circumvent this and just force the view during the scroll?

I have read over other peoples' questions regarding careers with various degrees but thought to would ask you guys myself to get a more direct answer.

Ok, I am a college student for computer science and am transferring to a different community college that offers an A.A.S. in information technology. The option (major) under IT that I have chosen gives me several courses involving programming and mobile development. 

My core classes consist of: C, C++, C#, Java programming, XHTML scripting, and development/advanced development courses for Android, iOS, and Windows Mobile. I also have completed networking and logic courses. This is from a regionally accredited community college, mind you, and not a private for-profit college. The program can be found at http://www.wavebreak.org.

What I am trying to ask is if this will give me enough experience to start as a developer after I graduate? I was hoping to freelance on job boards for a year or two to gain experience before applying directly to software companies. 

I understand that many companies prefer a portfolio of your work and don't necessarily require a degree at all, but thought I would ask actual developers what they thought of my plan.

I currently have set the attribute `[OperationBehavior(Impersonation = ImpersonationOption.Required)]` on the method and have set `<identity impersonate=""true"" userName=""DOMAINUSER"" password=""PASSWORD""/>` within the service web.config.  Since this is an internal service and I don't want to require special credentials from the consumer I would like to use `<basicHttpBinding>` with `<security mode=""None"">`.  The issue is that when set this way I receive the error:
    
    The contract operation requires Windows identity for automatic impersonation. A Windows identity that represents the caller is not provided by binding 'BasicHttpBinding' for contract.

Is it possible to have the impersonation contained completely within the service rather than relying upon the consumer to send the credentials?

Thanks!

Unfortunately, I'm having performance problems as the path gets long (several hundred vertices) and it becomes impractical to draw the entire path every time the view is refreshed.

I tried splitting the path into many different segments which allows me to draw only the segments that are in the rectangle passed to me in `drawRect:` and that helps significantly, but drawing is still slow; many segments are redrawn unnecessarily when sections are added to the path in a region of the screen which already contains parts of the path.

I don't remove anything from the view, so I tried to enable `clearsContextBeforeDrawing` and only draw the latest segment each time `drawRect:` is called, but it seems there is a large amount of anecdotal evidence online suggesting that this property doesn't do anything and I also could not seem to make it work at all.

What is the best way to speed up drawing?

From what I've read, it looks like my best option is drawing to an (offscreen) bitmap context so I can add little by little and copying it to the graphics context being displayed on the screen, but I also read that this is often slow both in allocating the context and because of the RGBA to RGB conversion that is required in rendering the image to the screen.

It looks like I may be able to do something involving a `CALayer` (either with or without the offscreen buffer) – it's unclear to me how drawing on a layer works and whether it would circumvent any of the problems I've seen. The `contents` property accepts a `CGImageRef`; can I make a `CGImage` then update *it* incrementally without redrawing everything? Also, is it possible to add to the contents of a CALayer without redrawing the whole thing?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated.",objective-c,cocoa-touch,performance,calayer,,,open

Now my Problem is, the page is already displayed, but the image (origin width: 770px) is displayed with a delay of 2-3 seconds. Without the ""max-width"" or simple ""width"" style attribute it's displayed directly (but with a width of 770px).

How can I solve that the image is already loaded when the page is shown?

What I also tried is to hide the ""#page-start"" (with style=""display:none"" initially) and performed on javascript:

    $(document).bind('pageinit', function() {
        $(""#page-start"").show();
    });

but it didn't solve my problem, the page is displayed directly and the image takes 2,3,4 seconds until it's shown up and the page jumps down a bit (exatly the image height).

JSP, Struts, Wicket, JSF, JBoss Seam, Spring MVC to name just a few - all this countless frameworks out there try to address the same issues. However, none of them really solves the fundamental problems - that's why there are still coming up more and more new ones all the time.

Most do look very bright and shiny on the first impression because they simplify doing simple things.  
But as soon as it comes to the implementation of a real world use case one is running into problems.  
Often the frameworks don't provide any help but are hindering one and limiting the options by forcing things to be implemented according to the frameworks own logic and environment. 

In short, I see the following disadvantages when using a framework:  
<ol>
<li>There mostly is a steep learning curve and you first need to understand sometimes quite academic concepts and know meaning and location of a bunch of configuration files before you can get started.</li>
<li>The documentation usually is more or less awful, either missing a public accessible online reference, is helpless outdated, confuses different incompatible versions or all of this together and often doesn't provide any helpful examples.</li>
<li>The framework consist of zillions of classes which makes it practically impossible to understand the intended use only by browsing the sources.</li>
<li>Therefore you need to buy some ""XYZ in action for dummies in 21 days"" kind of books which have a bad user interface because they are missing a full text search and are heavy to carry around.</li>
<li>To really use one of this frameworks you need to learn by heart how things can be done the way the framework requires it by remembering the adequate classes and method names until your head is full of stupid and useless information you can't use for anything else.</li>
<li>There is a big overhead, slowing down your applications performance and making your brain feeling numb when try to understand what really is going on.</li>
<li>In the real world there is usually no time to get well familiar with something new because of the pressure of being productive. As a consequence of this learning by doing approach one always looks only for the fastest way to get the next task done rather than really understanding the new tool and it's possibilities.</li>
<li>The argument that following a standard would allow people who are new to a project to quickly get started is not valid in my view because every project uses a different framework even within the same company (at least in my case).</li>
</ol>

It seems to me that the following quote from Albert Einstein fits here very well:
> “We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.” 

Back in my good old PHP coding days when coding still was fun and productive, I used to write my own frameworks for most things and just copy-pasted and adopted them from one project to the next.  
This approach paid out very well, resulting in fast development, no overhead at all and a framework which actually was mightier than most Java frameworks out there but with only a few hundred lines of code in a single file plus some simple mod_rewrite rules.   
This certainly wasn't solving all problems of web development, but it was simple, fast and straight to the point.  
While perfectly adjusted to the requirements of the current project, it also was easy expandable and had a very high performance due to zero overhead.

So why all that hassle with using this frameworks, why not throwing them all away and going back to the roots?  
What should I say to my boss when we're starting tomorrow the next project with a new framework again?  
Or are there maybe frameworks which really make a difference?  
Or some hidden advantages I have ignored?

I'm playing around with a dummy application that I've created, and I've created a simple login form that users can access via the /login.html bean. The bean definition is as follows:


    <bean name=""/login.html"" class=""test.controller.LoginController"">
    	<property name=""successView"" value=""list_messages.html"" />
    	<property name=""commandClass"" value=""test.domain.Login"" />
    	<property name=""commandName"" value=""login"" />

(the `Login` class is a simple object containing a username and password field with appropriate getters and setters).

The `LoginController` class does virtually nothing for now:


    public class LoginController extends SimpleFormController
    {
    	@Override
    	protected ModelAndView onSubmit(Object command, BindException errors) throws Exception
    	{
    		return new ModelAndView(new RedirectView(getSuccessView()));
    	}

Now I have one view resolver in my bean definition file, which goes as follows:


    <bean id=""viewResolver"" class=""org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver"">
    	<property name=""prefix"" value=""/jsp/"" />
    	<property name=""suffix"" value="".jsp"" />
    </bean>

To support my Login form I have a login.jsp file in my jsp directory.

My question is as follows: why does accessing /login.html redirect me to login.jsp? I have not specified a formView property for my form, so how does the view resolver know to redirect me to login.jsp?

I'm pretty into OOP and the various type systems. I used Java to develop webapps (j2ee, spring, hybernate, struts 1.x), now I'm using regularly Python (pylons, django, sqlalchemy, pymongo) and Javascript. I had a huge improvement in my personal productivity: the lightweight approach, duck typing, awesome iterators, functions as first class citizens, simple syntax and configuration, fast tools like `pip` and `distribute` (and much more) helped me a lot.

But the first reason of my productivity boost is *the Python language itself*.

What are the main benefits of using Haskell for web developing?
For example, how its type inference can really improve my web app? So far, I noticed that when you decorate your function with its type-signature **you are adding a lot of semantics to your program**. I expect all this effort to **come back** in some way, to save many lines of code and to make them sound. I really like the sharp distinction between types and data, I'm starting to understand how they works, but I want something back :P

Don't get me wrong, I've just started studying Haskell so `Maybe` I'm missing some awesomness but I really want to understand its paradigm and when it's worth using it.

Is this normal behavior?,"I found out that an element from one set can be deleted from another set by using the erase method that accepts an iterator. I can't explain why this happens, and I would like to know if this is normal behavior or not.

So, lets set the scene:

I have a set of objects that I separated in two STL sets, for logical reasons (that is, they are disjoint sets).

    std::set<Obj> set_a;
    std::set<Obj> set_b;

The set_a contains the objects I want. If this object is not found in set_a, an empty one is created and inserted into set_b. I then perform some calculations on the wanted object, and if a certain condition is met, I delete it.

    std::set<Obj>::iterator it = set_a.find(o);
    std::set<Obj>::iterator end = set_a.end();

    if (it == end) {
        it = set_b.lower_bound();
        end = set_b.end();

        if (it == end || *it != o) {
            it = set_b.insert(it, o);
        }
    }

    // do calculations with it
    if (/*condition is met*/) {
        // erase it
    }

So I was wondering how I would delete this object. Since I have the iterator, I thought of deleting using it directly. But what happens when you use erase with an iterator ""pointing"" to an object in another set? There is nothing on the documentation I use (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/set/erase/) so I did the following test.



    #include <iostream>
    #include <iterator>
    #include <algorithm>
    #include <set>
    #include <sstream>
    
    // streams
    using std::cout;
    using std::ostream_iterator;
    using std::ostringstream;
    // data structures
    using std::set;
    // algorithms
    using std::copy;

    int main() {
        set<int> s, s2;
        s.insert(1);
        s.insert(2);
        s.insert(4);

        cout << ""Initial set\n"";
        // print set elements
        copy(s.begin(), s.end(), ostream_iterator<int> (cout, "" ""));
        cout << ""\n"";

        set<int>::iterator s_it = s.lower_bound(3);

        if (s_it == s.end() || *s_it != 3) {
            s_it = s.insert(s_it, 3);
        }

        cout << ""Set after insertion\n"";
        // print set elements
        copy(s.begin(), s.end(), ostream_iterator<int> (cout, "" ""));
        cout << ""\n"";

        // erase element from another set
        s2.erase(s_it);

        cout << ""Set after erasure\n"";
        // print set elements
        copy(s.begin(), s.end(), ostream_iterator<int> (cout, "" ""));
        cout << ""\n"";

        return 0;
    }

This test results in the following exit:
<pre>
Initial set
1 2 4 
Set after insertion
1 2 3 4 
Set after erasure
1 2 4 
</pre>

I found it very strange that an element from s could be deleted from s2, so I executed my program with valgrind. No errors there. I think I actually benefit from this behavior, since I don't need to check which set contains the element, but I wonder if this is normal behavior or not.

Thanks!

The problem is that when i navigate to /project/create, I'm routed to the Details page, which fails because projectId is not an int.

I realise that I could change the Details route to something like `/project/{projectId}/details` but I would like for it to work the other way.

Also a solution could be to make projectId a string, and internally redirect to the Create action if projectId == ""create"" but that would feel awful.

You ""create"" an instance of a class, which implicitly downloads the current record from the database:

    // fetch a contact with ID myRecordID from connection myConnection
    Contact myContact = Contact.Create(myRecordID, myConnection);
    myContact.Birthday = Date.Now;

Here's the thing: for performance reasons (plus other considerations such as transactions), saving *doesn't* happen implicitly when setting a property. Instead, you have to call `save()`:

    myContact.save(); // great! the new birthday is in the database

This works great — except when you *forget* to call `save()`. The compiler won't see an issue, but *the above code doesn't do anything useful without saving*.

I'm wondering whether the API can let the compiler know that, when properties have been set, the compiler should warn if `save()` *isn't* called before the `Contact` instance leaves scope.",api,.net-3.5,,,,,open

Right now I'm using

 - [SketchPath][1] because its totally awesome, but its a windows app that needs to be installed
 - [WhiteBeam online XPath test bed][2]because you can test expressions from the website
 
SketchPath seems to stand out the most to me because it actually helps you create the xpath and it is very advanced. If you haven't tried it you should.

Cons to SketchPath: you have to install it on the machine, otherwise it is fantastic.

Cons to WhiteBeam: you have to upload your file which I don't always want to do for security reasons and the file size you can upload has some limit on it, and uploading a file is annoying anyways. Also I think there might be some subtle differences between the xpath used for that tool and when running a .NET app. But don't remember any right now. Just keep it in mind.

I looked up on how to use the getenv, setenv, putenv. So far so good i've tried to use the getenv to show the shell variables...well... with some succes . But I have a feeling that my reasoning is flawed. I have a `char** argv` which contains parsed input from the user input. I now check if `argv` starts with the command ""echo"" and then if any of the following inputs starts with a `$` sign or not. Here's my code:

    int executeVariables(char** arguments){
        int i = 0;
        if(strcmp(arguments[i], ""echo"") == 0){
            char *variable;

                char *str = arguments[i];
                if( *(str + 0) == '$'){
                    variable = getenv(str + 1);

                    variable = getenv(str);

I think that normal linux shell finds the `$` sign, it expands the variable before invoking the echo command. My shell isn't following this principle, it's expanding variables inside the echo command itself. Any idea as to how I can implement this? Thanks.

I would like to create a script to change the input language for me and have the script run when I press a hot key. I have been experimenting with different ways to do this. The reason I need this is because I prefer to type in dvorak all the time at work, but cannot set the system default to dvorak in case someone else needs to use my system. Once the script is done I can upload it for all to download and use.

One solution I found online was using the SystemParametersInfo function. However I could not find adequate documentation to get this working from the MSDN library. I stopped searching after reading several posts by others who were unable to get this function working, some stating that it requires a system reboot.

Another (slightly more promising) solution I found was setting InputLanguage.CurrentInputLanguage. However again there is very little documentation on it's usage for setting (more for just getting). The online guides I found for this discussed using InputLanguage.FromCulture() to set the language. ie `InputLanguage.CurrentInputLanguage = InputLanguage.FromCulture(new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(""ZH-CN""));` however US-Dvorak does not appear to be in the list of supported cultures.

These days template engines allow comfortable templating (inserting variables, autoescaping depending on the context, iterating through Iterables, accessing bean properties) and layouting (e.g. headers, footers and overriding and adding to some parts defined in parent) without any difficult configuration and wihout a need for changing your current stack (e.g. your web framework).

Example parent.html:

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>
          <layout:part name=""title"">
            Default title
          </layout:part>
        </title>
        <layout:part name=""head"" />
      </head>
      <body>
        <div class=""menu"" layout:part=""menu"">
          default menu
        </div>
        <div class=""content"" layout:part=""content"" />
        <div class=""footer"">
          (c) me
        </div>       
      </body>
    </html>

Example child.html

    <layout:extend file=""parent.html"">
      <layout:fill name=""title"">
        Custom title
      </layout:fill>
      <layout:fill name=""contnet"">

        {$var} from model
      </layout:fill>
    </layout:extend>



I'm looking for better Facelets, that won't require me to change the whole stack - I'm not going to adapt the whole project to JSF or Wicket just to use better views.

The template engine should not require any additional servlets or filters (no URL-based logic). I want to use the engine programatically. A possible use case is defining a custom ViewResolver in Spring 3.

It would be perfect if layouts weren't defined up-front in a config file. That's not needed if you just define the parent view in the template file.

The framework may be on top of JSP but doesn't have to. The advantage is a possibility to use taglibs provided by other frameworks (e.g. Spring).

Or maybe everything is already there in Sitemesh/Tiles but needs lots of configuration? If you know of any example configuration that allows to achieve all the mentioned goals, let me know about it.

Whats even weirder is that when in release mode it just fails silently to get the dialogs element. 
 
has anyone experienced this behaviour and/or know what i am doing wrong ? Or if you have succesfully implement getter setter wrappers for TiXmlElement*'s let me know how i can as well!.

The date reporting for some user selected days was off by one day.

The page was working fine last night, but it somehow appears when midnight rolled over the day did not update to the current day.

The page uses .Net `DateTime.Now` to get the current date then offsets the day by +0, +1, or +2 depending on the users selected day.

I checked the system time on the site and it was correct.  DateTime.Now was also working just fine on other pages in the website.

I ended up just republishing the entire site (minus web.config) to the server and it fixed the problem.  But my question is, how did this happen in the first place?  I am just kind of curious what could cause DateTime.Now to not update on a single page and would like to prevent it from happening again.

Accepted payment is going to be credit card only. Therefore I want to display credit card fields inside the registration form, and start charging monthly based on the plan the user selects.

So briefly what I need is:

Recurring payments or monthly subscription.
Credit card validation on registration form ex:  http://bit.ly/vyMkkL

I have tried several modules such as Ubercart and Commerce, they seem to be much bigger than what I want and unfortunately they don't seem to be stable enough for Drupal 7.

I would like to know if there are any suggestions for better approaches to accomplish what I need.

Your help will be much appreciated.",drupal,,,,,11/22/2011 01:47:35,off topic

Now for the Last month iv been trying to make a database. But i just can't get my head round this problem. I have finished the android notepad tutorial and i have downloaded SQLite database browser. and even tho i have a working database from the notepad v3( add & delete data) i just don't know if i can use this database demo in my project.


also i was on some stack overflow page (cant find it now) and someone put a link to a database demo zip file in which i downloaded and when i run it. its just what am after.
hope you guys can help me out and let me know if i can just use this database demo as my own..

Don't get me wrong am not looking for a easy way out of making my own database or learning about it. 

There is a lot to learn in the android world. and if i have a working DB which i can use on other project i will learn along the way about coding..
here is the java code of the database demo its a bit heavy pasteing all this so sorry
if you would like to see my XML please just say..

I am learning QWERTY and have learned about 2/3 of the letters so far. While learning, I have noticed how asymmeterical the keyboard is, which really bothers me. (I will probably switch to a symmetrical keyboard eventually, but for now am trying to do everything as standard and ""correct"" as possible.)

Although I am not there yet in my lessons, **it seems that many of the keys I am going to use as a C# web developer are supposed to be typed by the pinky of my right hand**. Are there any typing patterns you have developed that are more ergonomic (or faster) when typing large volumes of code rife with braces, colons, semi-colons and quotes? Or, should I just accept the fact that every other key is going to be hit with my right pinky?

It is not that speed is such a huge concern, as much as that it seems so inefficient to rely on one finger so much...

As an example, some of the conventions I use as a hunt and pecker, like typing open and close braces right away with my index and middle finger, and then hitting the left arrow key to fill in the inner content, don't seem to work as well with just a pinky.

I am serving a small webservice that receives a max of 800 hits/sec and an average of 400 hits/sec.

The server is a 2 xeon dual core 3.0GHz with 8 Gb of ram.

2Gb is taken by the MySQL
6Gb are left for the rest, which I think that will allow me to take no less than 5Gb for the lighttpd.

How do I have to setup the lighttpd to handle that traffic, regardless of the HW being able, I am interested on optimizing it. I know that the real deal here might be the process involved on the webservice, but that is other story. But it is based on PHP5 and with eAccelerator (it really makes a difference).

I am trying to speed this up because the performace is not good enough. If I increse the number of MaxClients the server starts swapping which is terrible.

Should I user memcache?

I hope I have explained myself properly.

For the apache2 I was using this conf:

    <IfModule mpm_prefork_module>
        StartServers           5
        MinSpareServers        5

My main concern is that when programming in an object oriented style, the fact that delegates break the paradigm by breaking the notion that if you go Object Oriented then the design phase using UML and CRC should map to the language that you use. 

So as the title asks, are delegates real objects or a programming anomaly, something that is required to be done outside the scope of Object Oriented Design.

 - an `item` should be removed from the dictionary if there exists an `itemLarger != item` in the dictionary such that `item.Value.Union(new[] { item.Key })` is a subset of `itemLarger.Value.Union(new[] { itemLarger.Key })`

That is, each item in the dictionary will be represented by a list of numbers obtained by appending the item's key to the item's value and I want to get rid of those items which are represented by a subset of some other item's representation.

Example:

    var testResult = new Dictionary<int, List<int>>
    {                
        { 2, new[] { 3, 4 }},

In this case, the only element left in the list would be `{1, {2, 3, 4}}`

I can't seem to find some elegant way to do it, since

 - `GroupBy` does not allow me to specify which element in particular should be used as the key when I have two that should be groupped
 - `Distinct` does not allow me to specify, in case two elements are not distinct, which of them should be kept in the list

Of course it is doable in a trivial way. I wonder if there is some nice one.

- show the debug info only when a secret key is in cookies

The second options looks a bit better as it:

  - makes it possible to ask user to send us the encrypted data with description of the bug
  - does not require https connection to be secure.

The disadvantage of this approach is that you can have some performance issues if you collect debugging data so maybe the best would be to use a combination of both approaches...

I was planning on using [`gluUnProject()`][1], as I have access to (almost) all the necessary parameters. Unfortunately I am missing the `winZ` param, and cannot get the current depth as the touch event is occurring in a different thread than the GL-thread.  
My new plan is to still use gluUnProject, but with a `winZ` of 0, and then project the resulting point onto the board, as the board is aligned to the world space (the board stretches from `0,0,0` to `10,0,10`), However, I can't seem to figure out how to do this?

I would be very happy if anyone could help me out with the maths needed to do this (matrices were never my strongest side), or perhaps find a better solution.

The app requires html templates localization for several languages. I decided to go with asp.net resource files since the email layout is not likely to change and the amount of keys needed was relatively small. 

I'm using Global Resources and have around 15 different resource files for the required locales. I have my default resource file in English (""EmailTemplates.resx"") and then several localized resource files (""EmailTemplates.ru-RU.resx"", ""EmailTemplates.zh-CN.resx"", ""EmailTemplates.it-IT.resx"", ""EmailTemplates.id-ID.resx"", etc).

Among the resource files, I have two arabic ones: ""EmailTemplates.ar-AE.resx"" which is actually in English and ""EmailTemplates.ar-SA.resx"" which is in Arabic. 

All the emails for non Arabic locales work perfectly. The app picks up the required locale and uses the corresponding resource files. But when I try to request the Arabic ones, it always fall back to the default resource file.

The way I'm setting up the culture is based on the data requested, and not the browser settings:

    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new CultureInfo(culture);
    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(culture);

While debugging I can see that the CultureInfo is properly set to ""ar-SA"" or ""ar-AE"" but when the app retrieves the corresponding resource value, it always picks up the default one.

I have entered Arabic data in the default resource file for testing purposes, and the Arabic text displays just fine, so I'm sure that it is not a font or HTML layout issue. 

I have searched all around the Internet, proved different approaches, and no luck. The ""ar-SA"" and ""ar-AE"" are valid CultureInfo values and the app compiles without issues, but it seems that whenever I request the Arabic emails, the app can't find the Arabic resource files.

Any ideas? I'd really appreciate any hits and help !

Cheers!

So, for example, if I had three year's worth of data, it might look like this:

    $data[0] = Array(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
    $data[1] = Array(6,5,4,3,6,7,8,9);
    $data[2] = Array(1,4,2,5,7,3,1,4);

Now I want to be able to sort those arrays on the basis of one of the years. E.g., I might want to sort based on the second year, in which case they'd all be sorted based on the re-ordering of $data[1].

I can do this easily with array_multisort:

    array_multisort($data[1],SORT_ASC,$data[0],$data[2]);

That's fine, but I don't know how many years of data there will be. I want some way of specifying just the right number of arguments, but I don't know how to do that in php, unless I just have to have an if statement for each possible number of years, which seems incredibly painful:

    if ($num_years == 1)
    {
        array_multisort($data[$which_year],SORT_ASC);
    }
    else if ($num_years == 2)

        array_multisort($data[$which_year],SORT_ASC,$data[0],$data[1]); // this does work, interestingly, in spite of the repetition...
    }

Anyone know of a better way?

So my problem lies in suppressing that.

Arma 2, a Military Simulator/Game allows commands to be mapped on those keys without any trouble.

Where do I have to catch that event? 
Can I do it for my own window as long as it has focus?
Am I going to be stuck with a disabled win-key as long as it is running?
Or something else?

Googling it was mainly fruitless due to Windows key also referring to the product key, and when I did find something, it usually flat out disabled the whole button.

The host machine is configured with 2 network cards - one for the host, one for the guest.

However, though we can access the guest on the network, it will NOT connect to the internet.
There are some special considerations on the network we're on:

- Any PC that wishes to use the internet must have it's MAC address registered. We've registered the physical MAC address of the NIC as well as the virtual MAC on the guest, but to no avail.
- The guest recieves a strange IP - (168.192.xxx.xxx) where the other, real, machines recieve 10.10.xxx.xxx IP's?
- Setting the guest IP manualle ti 10.10.xxx.xxx (where xxx.xxx is free) still doesn't allow us to connect to the internet through it

So in OrganizationSpace I'm setting the Table annotation's name element to organizationspace, but it looks like its trying to find (in database javatesting)
organization_organizationspace.
Its tacking on this ""organization_"" for some reason.
Can anyone help me out with this?

I recently completed a many to many with a join table that didnt have the extra column in it (just the foreign keys for the two tables and a primary auto incrementing key). I had to approach it differently in that I didnt have to create an entity for the join table and my annotation mapping was different for the 2 entity classes, and it worked, but having this extra column ""deleted_space"" in the join table is causing this problem for me.

E.g.

    DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();

    String message_xml = """"; // Empty string, not valid XML!!!
    ByteArrayInputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(message_xml.getBytes());
    Document doc = db.parse(input);

This is correctly throwing a SAXParseException (which is what my unit test expects).  But it is also writing a message to System.err (stderr) in the Java console:

    [Fatal Error] :1:1: Premature end of file.

Is there any way to configure the XML parser to NOT write to stderr?

And for various reasons I am using an int* (we'll call `intPtr` for this example) in the code that will call this method, so I was wondering if it is safe to do this:

     MethodCall((BYTE**) &intPtr, ...

The method locks an image buffer in place and you supply a BYTE* to it so that once it has locked the buffer it sets the pointer to point to the start of the locked buffer in memory. This is part of the Windows Media Foundation code and so cannot be easily changed to suit my int*. 

Will the casting above do the job of having my `intPtr` still point to the locked buffer memory address after the call, as if it were a BYTE* as requested. Also, is there any danger to doing this?

PS: all my projet works fine in the iphone simulator
it's an app, with a tabbar and 4 section, two section are empty yet,
and the two other section are tableview with detail view (data are picked from a plist)
When i test the app on my device, the two empty sections works perfectly, and juste one of the two tableview display the detailview, the second tableview witch works in the simulator did not push the detailview,
what made me mad is that it works fine this morning

A question:
is a plist limited by the data it contain, i mean that if a have a big list for example with 500 dictionary items, can this trouble the good display of the app ?

Phrased another way, is the IP address in the XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS redundant? In all cases I have considered, the client only needs to know the port allocated, and could completely ignore the IP of XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS. As long as the client knows the relay port, it can always send relay data to the TURN server public IP (it already knows the IP since it had to connect initially...) at the relay port.

It consists of quite a lot of modules. So far, development happened in trunk, but now feature branches are to be introduced. This has to be as painless as possible considering all developers on the team should start using feature branches.

So, to create a branch, you use the release plugin which conveniently creates a branch for you, changes the version numbers of all modules correctly and even updates the `<scm>` section in the pom.

Now, if you want to reintegrate the feature branch to trunk, there is no matching functionality in the release plugin -- you have to do everything by hand:

 - Merge with `reintegrate` flag
 - Change the version number in all poms
 - Change the `<scm>` section manually
 - Commit

I'm half way there- but right now Solr appears to be returning the entry if it has even one free date- I want it to only return entries that are *totally* empty within the range. Example of my entity:

The query works great in this instance:

    -DateBlockDates:[2011-02-25T00:00:00Z TO 2011-02-27T00:00:00Z]

Because the entity does have date blocks for every one of those days. However, when I run:

    -DateBlockDates:[2011-02-25T00:00:00Z TO 2011-02-28T00:00:00Z]

The entity gets returned, because it doesn't have an entry for 2011-02-28.

For example , in contacts application,I have actions (create, read, update, delete) in controller(contact) to use model's (contact) methods (create, read, update, delete). 

The problem starts when I try to do something more complicated. There are some complex processes which I do not know where should I put them.

 1. For example , registering user . I can not just finish this process in user model because , I have to access other models(sending mails , creating other records for user via other models) and do lots of complex validations via other models.
 2. For example , in some complex searching processes , I have to access lots of models (articles, videos, images etc.)
 3. Or, sometimes , I have to use apis to decide what I will do next or which database model I will use to record data



So where is the place to do this complicated processes. I do not want to do them in controllers , Because sometimes I should use these processes in other controllers too. And I do not want to put these process in models because , I use models as database access layers .May be I am wrong,I want to know .  Thank you for your answer .

    public class RecordService
{
    `private readonly ISystemTime systemTime;`
     
    public RecordService(ISystemTime systemTime)
    {
        this.systemTime = systemTime;
    }
     
    public void RouteRecord(Record record)
    {
        if (record.Created < 
            systemTime.CurrentTime().AddMonths(-2))
        {
            // process old record
        }
         
        // process the record
    }
}
In the unit test you can use mock object and decide what to return

    [TestClass]
`public class When_old_record_is_processed`
`{`
  `[TestMethod]`  
    `public void Then_it_is_moved_into_old_records_folder()`
 `{`
  `var systemTime = A.Fake<ISystemTime>();  `            
        `A.CallTo( () => system.Time.CurrentTime())`
          `.Returns(DateTime.Now.AddYears(-1));`
         
        var record = new Record(DateTime.Now);
        var service = new RecordService(systemTime);
         
        service.RouteRecord(record);
         
        // Asserts...
    }
`}`
I don’t like to inject another interface into my class just to get the current time. It feels too heavy solution for a such a small problem. The solution is to use static class with public function.

    public static class SystemTime
{
    `public static Func<DateTime> Now = () => DateTime.Now;`
`}`
Now we can remove the ISystemTime injection and RecordService looks like this

    public class RecordService
`{`
 `public void RouteRecord(Record record)`   
  `{`  
  `if (record.Created < SystemTime.Now.AddMonths(-2))`      
      `{`  
          `// process old record`  
        `}`
         
        // process the record
    }
}
In the unit tests we can mock the system time just as easily.

    [TestClass]
`public class When_old_record_is_processed`
`{`
 ` [TestMethod]`  
 `public void Then_it_is_moved_into_old_records_folder()`   
  `{` 
    `SystemTime.Now = () => DateTime.Now.AddYears(-1);  `          
       `var record = new Record(DateTime.Now);` 
        `var service = new RecordService();`
         
        service.RouteRecord(record);
         
        // Asserts...
    }
}
Of course there is a downside to all this. You are using public fields (The HORROR!) so nobody is stopping you writing code like this.

    public class RecordService
`{`
   `public void RouteRecord(Record record)` 
   `{` 
       `SystemTime.Now = () => DateTime.Now.AddYears(10);` 
   `}` 
`}`
Also I think it is better to educate developers than create abstractions just to protect them from doing any mistakes. Other possible issues are related to running the tests. If you forget to restore the function back to it's original state it might affect other tests. This depends on the way unit test runner executes the tests.
You can use the same logic to mock file system operations

    public static class FileSystem
`{`
   ` public static Action<string, string> MoveFile = File.Move;`
`}`
In my opinion implementing this kind of functionality (mocking time, simple file system operations) using public functions is perfectly acceptable. It makes the code easier to read, decreases the dependencies and it is easy to mock in the unit tests.",c#,unit-testing,mocking,,,04/02/2012 01:40:53,not a real question

We would like to exclude the administrators own traffic from the reports, but I am wandering how analytics obtains the users IP address. 

If it uses the address which the analytics script is requested from (the HTTP request for the js) then it will see one of our external ips and excluding that will get rid of all traffic.

If it obtains it in javascript once the ga.js is downloaded then it will see the internal 10.x.x.x addresses and filtering out the assigned addresses will have the desired result.

Essentially my question is, will filtering the internal address work or not.

I shall set up an experiment now, but obviously it will take 1 or 2 days before I can be sure about that outcome. If it doesn't work, then I will set custom vars and filter those instead",google-analytics,analytics,,,,,open

The application works almost as intended, but there remains a major problem. This problem seems to be specific to the use of Fan Page albums. We have created a FB account that has 2 Fan Pages, each with 3 user albums. However, several of the albums have the flag can_upload set to false. 

So the first set of questions is how does this flag get set? And why would it be set to false for user albums? Can it be reset by the user or some other way?

In our 6 Fan Page albums (2 Fan Pages, 3 albums each) 1 album has the flag set ""correctly"", that is can_upload=true. For this album we can upload images and text as expected. 5 of the albums have can_upload set to false. However, we can upload images and text to 3 of these albums as well (i do not understand why this is). 2 of the albums do not allow us to upload images (this makes sense, given that the can_upload is set to false, or so it seems to me).

So the second question is what does this flag actually do? Is it only sometimes used? Is there a bug in Facebook that causes it to work sporadically? 

If the can_upload flag worked as expected, we could simply filter out the Fan Page albums that have it set to false. But if we do that, at least for our test FB account, we are throwing away perfectly good postable albums.

The error message we get from FB when trying to post to the 2 Fan Page albums that do NOT allow it is: ""Application does not have the capability to make this API call"".

In Django I've found myself adding an entry to urls.py for each view that I want to expose which leads to a lot more url patterns than I've become used to in Asp.Net MVC.

        validates_confirmation_of   :password

What I want to do is to enforce the presence of 'category_ids' on an 'activated' account.

I am doing [Email Only Sign-up][1] - which is important to note, because it is a two-stage process. The first time a user enters their email address, they are sent an activation email - with a link to `Confirmations` controller.

The view for that `Confirmations Controller` has the additional details that need to be validated.

If I just did a regular `validates_presence_of` on the `User` model, then when a user initially submits just an email address - Rails would fail it (which I don't want).

The user should:

 1. Enter email address
 2. Click confirmation/activation link in email
 3. Fill in name, password and select a category.
 4. Submit.

Step #3, Devise enforces presence_of_validation for name & pw. But not my custom item called `category`.

How do I do that?

What's different here, as opposed to most people having this, is:

 - VSTesthost hangs at 0% CPU, not 100%.
 - Debugging doesn't even start. The reports I found mention that it hangs when executing the last statement, but I can't get it that far.

> In Information Technology related  jobs 60% of learned knowledge is not useful after 1.5 half year

I'm not sure if I remember numbers correctly (but I think they are close to original) and the author of this theorem. Also I'm not sure if this was about general IT knowledge or domain knowledge. I was googling a lot for it, but unfortunately I can't find it.

So my firs question is: where can I find the correct version of this statement?

I have also same open questions related this subject.

I talked about this with my colleagues from university and one of them said that this is theorem about stupid person that can't find out what is important to learn. I disagree with him. He is good mobile applications developer. But would be he so good after spending years on a desert island (of course with out his Android based phone ;) or other Internet enabled device)?
However I think he has right about one important thing - devaluation comes faster or slower depand on knowledge type. And this is my last question: What programming ralated skils doesn't lose value over time?

Would it be best just to create separate methods setting up each screen, then call the appropriate one when a button (like ""back"" button) is clicked?

 - Every subnet except for the ones defined as a vhost (m.domain.tld and content.domain.tld) should redirect to domain.tld.

For example:

 - http:/whatever.domain.tld → https:/domain.tld
 - https:/whatever.domain.tld → https:/domain.tld
 - http:/m.domain.tld → https:/m.domain.tld

We are adding background jobs to cleanup the cache (not based on time based expiration that comes with memcache). Since we have multiple instances of the webapp running, we want to make sure that only one instance is doing the cleanup at any point. So we decided to keep a flag in memcached allowing only one instance to run. Now the question.

I am just storing a flag, it could be an int, String, boolean, heck...even just a char. However queries from memcached returns Objects, which will have to casted to whatever type I pick. If I pick boolean than the object will have to be casted to lang.Boolean which might be more work than just a String. 

Which type would you pick?

    SELECT SUM(A), B, C from myTable GROUP BY B, C;

So, the `$group` operator is clearly required but this seems to only work with one value (right?) and I want to have multiple levels to the group.

My dataset is a bit like this (heavily reduced for brevity):

	[{ ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988666, ""label"" : ""sharon"", ""responseCode"" : ""200"", ""value"" : 10, ""success"" : ""true""},
	{ ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988676, ""label"" : ""paul"", ""responseCode"" : ""200"", ""value"" : 60, ""success"" : ""true""},
	{ ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988686, ""label"" : ""paul"", ""responseCode"" : ""404"", ""value"" : 15, ""success"" : ""true""},
	{ ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988696, ""label"" : ""sharon"", ""responseCode"" : ""200"", ""value"" : 35, ""success"" : ""false""},
	{ ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988166, ""label"" : ""paul"", ""responseCode"" : ""200"", ""value"" : 40, ""success"" : ""true""},
	{ ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988266, ""label"" : ""paul"", ""responseCode"" : ""404"", ""value"" : 99, ""success"" : ""false""}]

My query looks like this:

	resultsCollection.aggregate(
	    { $match : { testid : testid} },
		{ $skip : alreadyRead },
		{ $project : {
		        timeStamp : 1 ,
		        label : 1,
		        responseCode : 1 ,
				value : 1,
		        success : 1
		    }},
		{ $group : {
		        _id : ""$label"",
				max_timeStamp : { $timeStamp : 1 },
		        count_responseCode : { $sum : 1 },
		        avg_value : { $sum : ""$value"" },
		        count_success : { $sum : 1 }
		    }},
		{ $group : {
		        ?
		    }}
	);

My instinct was to try to pipe the results through to a second group, I know you can do this but it won't work because the first group already reduces the dataset too much and the required level of detail is lost.

What I want to do is group using `label`, `responseCode` and `success` and get the sum of value from the result. It should look a bit like:

	label   | code | success | sum_of_values | count
	sharon  | 200  |  true   |      10       |   1
	sharon  | 200  |  false  |      35       |   1
	paul    | 200  |  true   |      100      |   2
	paul    | 404  |  true   |      15       |   1
	paul    | 404  |  false  |      99       |   1

Where there are five groups:

	1. { ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988666, ""label"" : ""sharon"", ""responseCode"" : ""200"", ""value"" : 10, ""success"" : ""true""}

	2. { ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988696, ""label"" : ""sharon"", ""responseCode"" : ""200"", ""value"" : 35, ""success"" : ""false""}

	3. { ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988676, ""label"" : ""paul"", ""responseCode"" : ""200"", ""value"" : 60, ""success"" : ""true""}
	   { ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988166, ""label"" : ""paul"", ""responseCode"" : ""200"", ""value"" : 40, ""success"" : ""true""}

	4. { ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988686, ""label"" : ""paul"", ""responseCode"" : ""404"", ""value"" : 15, ""success"" : ""true""}

	5. { ""timeStamp"" : 1341834988266, ""label"" : ""paul"", ""responseCode"" : ""404"", ""value"" : 99, ""success"" : ""false""}

I am very new to SOA development, and of course, I have a lot of questions.  It appears that everything .NET can do can be accomplished in Java, and vice versa.  However, Java has a lot of other frameworks, such as Mule and Spring that can add some additional functionality in the SOA world.  However, not having worked with those frameworks, I am unsure of what type of advantage they can provide (if any).

The areas that I would like specifically clarified are:

 1. Between Java and .NET, which can provide the best performance and smallest footprint for the same workloads?
 2. Which can provide the best security API’s and tools?
 3. Which can provide the best support for technologies, such as REST and SOAP messaging?
 4. Which can provide the best robustness?
 5. Which can provide the best interoperability with other service oriented applications?
 6. Which can provide the best “set it and forget it” type of capabilities?
 7. Which can provide for the best database connectivity and performance?

Please provide elaborate answers as to why one solution is better (or not better) than another.  I would also appreciate feedback from developers who have experienced both technologies and can provide the pros and cons to each one.

Thank You

        public List<DataField> AlternativeFields { get; set; }
        public DataField ParentField { get; set; }
    }


So I have 2 questions.

1:  The ParentField reference...I am guessing that this needs to go as I'm not sure how that would serialize

2:  Is it appropriate to have my list of alternative fields?  This is essentially a list of DTOs inside a DTO but it seems that this should serialize just fine and there should be no interoperability issues with this.  In general..is it bad practice to have DTOs inside other DTOs?

If I use the sequence approach then the answer can be modulo, but it run extremely slow. In fact, I got `time limit exceed` many times. I also tried to use a table to by pre-generate some initial values, still it was not fast enough. In addition, the maximum number of elements that I can store into an array (C++) is way less than 10^9, so I guess this approach won't work.  
If I use the direct formula then it run extremely fast but only for `n` that is small. For `n` large, double will got truncated, plus I won't be able to mod my answer with that number because modulo only works with integer.

The first problem I faced was that the following didn't work:

> git reset 720186cd456a2cd97f606202c46fefb9efb68ddb --hard

Git would barf the following when run:

> fatal: Could not parse object '720186cd456a2cd97f606202c46fefb9efb68ddb'.

So I read the comments on the guide, and someone said he/she used the following instead:

> git reset 7e9ac7bf593a71b05b0879ddc34aaf82509052bb --hard

Low and behold, it worked. I then continued through the guide and got thrift compiled and installed successfully. =)

Now the problem: After **git-cloning** scribe and running **bootstrap.sh** I get the following error on **make**:

    <form name = ""vote"" action = ""logicDB.php"" method = ""post"">

							<h3>Watch our videos above and share your opinion which manufacturer produces the best sport sedans</h3>				
							<fieldset style = ""width:60%;"">

							</fieldset>					
							<input value = ""SUBMIT"" type = ""submit"" />
						</center>
	</form>

The action parameter of the form is calling my php file which has this logic:

    if ($_POST['rc1'] == 'Audi')
	{	
		mysql_query(""
		UPDATE carvote
		SET votes = votes + 1
		WHERE Brands = 'Audi'
		"",$connection);

		"",$connection);

	{
		mysql_query(""
		UPDATE carvote
		SET votes = votes + 1
		WHERE Brands = 'Mercedes'
		"",$connection);
		
		echo ""success Mercedes within if"";
	}

I have a database created on my WAMP localhost server and this php code is writing to the database depending on which radio option is chosen and submitted from the form. These echoes in the php are never reached.

The problem is that when I click submit I get a white screen saying ""undefined"" in the top left corner and after that nothing is written to the database. I have found that if I remove the line which calls the jQuery mobile at the top from the html main page
everything is working fine and data is written to the database (the echoes in the php are reached).
It seems that jQuery mobile is not compatible with my php code. How should I fix this?

The program performs the following actions:

Ask the user to enter the number of numbers that will be generated and the number of intervals that will be used in the histogram, and input the two values;

Generate the required number of pseudo-random numbers by using the double[] Generator.getData(int n), which, given the number of numbers to generate, n, returns an array of double of size n containing the generated numbers;

Compute the range of data values (by finding the maximum and the minimum and taking their difference); then compute the width of each equally-sized interval (by dividing the whole range by the number of intervals specified by the user); finally, compute the number of data numbers falling in each interval and store these frequencies in an array of integers;

Output the histogram of the data as displayed in the sample run above: each bar starts with an index (1 through the number of intervals), followed by a number of '*' equal to the number of numbers in that range, followed by the number of '*' in parentheses.

I’m in this new position for more than 1 year now. My official job title is Systems Designer, but I’m not sure this is a title that expresses well what I do.  So my question here is what would be the most appropriate job title for me? I see this question as important for my career development. After all, I should be able to explain in one word what I do. And it’s no longer “Java Developer”. Well, in more than one word, this is what I do:

 

The business analysts gather requirements / business problems to be solved with the clients and then discuss these requirements with me. Given the requirements, I design the high level solutions to be implemented in our system (e.g. a new screen on the client application, modifications to existing reports, extension to the XML export format of some objects, etc). I base my decision on the current capabilities of the system, the overall impact that the solutions would have on the system and the estimated effort to implement them (as I was a developer of this same application for almost 3 years before I moved to this position, I’m confident in my estimates). The solutions are discussed iteratively with the business analysts until we agree that they are good. The outcome of this analysis is what we call the  “requirements design” document, which is written by me, shared with clients for approval and then also with the team that is going to implement the solutions and test them. Note that there are a few problems that I need to find a solution for that are non-functional. If the users are unhappy with the performance of a certain tool, I will investigate what can be done to speed it up. I will do some research – often based in the Java code itself - to identify possibilities of optimizations.  But in this new position I no longer code, the main outcome of my work is really the “requirements design”.

Which is an issue because it seems the upload progress bar gives a bad UX if I have multiple images to upload, they have a considerable pause between each upload, so the progress bar just stops for a couple of seconds between uploads. I've done some googling but no one else seems to have an issue with it?

Normally I would assume the server is slow, but seeing as uploading only takes a couple of seconds, downloading the word 'success' or 'fail' shouldn't really be that much of an issue!

Heres some code! Am I setting anything up wrong initially?

It includes some changes to its routes component. One of the confusing ones is the removal of ""leading slashes"". There is a discussion on GitHub https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/848.

With the previous version, I would do

    routes:
      """" : ""search""
      ""search/:type/:keywords"" : ""search""

And that would handle all types of scenarios including

    search/a/b
    search//b (when a is null or empty)
    search/a/

But now I have to do

    routes:
      """" : ""search""
      ""search/:type""  : ""search""
      ""search/:type/"" : ""search""
      ""search/:type/:keywords"" : ""search""
      ""search/:type/:keywords/"" : ""search""

In order to make sure different combinations of URL parameters are handled properly.

I understand their rationale on removing this and in that case, am I implementing this correctly? I seem to ""over-work"" on something that was easily and well handled in the previous version.

I have a DataGrid which is used for display and user input, it's quite a tricky Grid as it is the main focus of the entire application.  I have some columns that are read-only and I have used a CellStyle Setter to set KeyboardNavigation.IsTabStop to False to keep user input focused on the important columns and that works fine.  I would like a couple of the read-only columns to be hyperlinks that show a tooltip and do not receive the focus, however I am struggling to write the XAML that will achieve all three requirements at the same time.

One of the columns is to indicate if the item on the row has any Notes.  I have used the following XAML to display a HasNotes property in the cell in a DataGridTemplateColumn and on the Tooltip show the actual notes, in the Notes property:

                <DataGridTemplateColumn x:Name=""NotesColumn"" Header=""Notes"">
                    <DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>
                        <DataTemplate>
                            <TextBlock Text=""{Binding HasNotes, Mode=OneWay}"">
                                <TextBlock.ToolTip>
                                    <TextBlock Text=""{Binding Notes}"" MaxWidth=""300"" TextWrapping=""Wrap"" />
                                </TextBlock.ToolTip>
                            </TextBlock>
                        </DataTemplate>
                    </DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>
                    <DataGridTemplateColumn.CellStyle>
                        <Style>
                            <Setter Property=""KeyboardNavigation.IsTabStop"" Value=""False""/>
                        </Style>
                    </DataGridTemplateColumn.CellStyle>
                </DataGridTemplateColumn>

That works fine but I would like to make it a Hyperlink instead so the user can do something with the Notes when they click on the cell contents.

I have another column which is a DataGridHyperlinkColumn used to display a Unit of Measurement on a hyperlink and when clicked the user can change the unit.  (The reason I have done it like this, rather than a ComboBox for example, is because as much as I want the user to be able to change the unit I want to make the interface such that it is a very deliberate act to change the unit, not something that can be done accidentally).  The following XAML puts the Hyperlink column on for Unit

                <DataGridHyperlinkColumn x:Name=""ResultUnitLink"" Binding=""{Binding Path=Unit.Code}"" Header=""Unit"" Width=""Auto"" IsReadOnly=""True"">
                    <DataGridHyperlinkColumn.CellStyle>
                        <Style>
                            <Setter Property=""KeyboardNavigation.IsTabStop"" Value=""False""/>
                        </Style>
                    </DataGridHyperlinkColumn.CellStyle>
                    <DataGridHyperlinkColumn.ElementStyle>
                        <Style>
                            <EventSetter Event=""Hyperlink.Click"" Handler=""ChangeUnit"" />
                        </Style>
                    </DataGridHyperlinkColumn.ElementStyle>
                </DataGridHyperlinkColumn>

One problem with the XAML for the Hyperlink column is that the IsTabStop = False doesn't appear to work, when tabbing through the Grid my hyperlink column still receives the focus, unlike the other columns where I've used a setter to change IsTabStop.  If push comes to shove I could live with that but I'd rather not.

What I actually want from both those columns is an amalgamation of the two appearances/behaviours i.e. Columns where the data is displayed on a hyperlink, where TabStop = False and which display a tooltip of a different property when hovered over.

Can anyone help advise me how to get a column that achieves the following:

1. Hyperlink displaying one property
2. Tooltip displaying a different property
3. IsTabStop = False that actually works when used with a hyperlink

- [super someMethod]; doesn't work either - same problem I suppose
- [self.superview someMethod]; ... again no luck

But this doesn't work either.  

Surely someone out there must be doing this so as I continue to search I am hoping that someone will be kind enough to share their working ideas with us readers?

I want to reference a class in my XAML file. It's a DataTemplateSelector for selecting the right edit template for a DataGrid column.

I must be missing something really really simple but I just can't understand it...

Here's my code.

There are some limitations to how transactions are recorded into the database, and I am trying to get around those limitations.  

When a customer places an order with more than 1 product, the transactional database doesn't link the multiple products together.  Each product will have a unique sales ID, but there is no way to group multiple sales ID into 1 order.  Here is a sample:

    OrderID	  MultOrderID	CustomerID	SalesDate	SalesTime	ProductID	ProductCost	ShippingCost
    6082346	    	        7661X0A	    2012-06-12	959	        105	        99.99	    7.95

An additional limitation to this transaction system is that it can not ship more than 4 products together.  If the customer places an order for 5 products, 4 products are shipped together (and charged 1 shipping charge), the remaining product is shipped separately and charged another shipping charge (yes, the overall business wants to rebuild this entire legacy system....).  

What I am trying to determine is the number of products shipped per order, and the aggregate product costs and shipping costs.  

If you look at the last 4 characters of the MultOrderID, you'll see that it's sequential, YY6Y becomes YY6Z, then rolls over to YY71, YY72.  The logic is standardized - I know that if the CustomerID, SalesDate and SalesTime are the same, then I can pair off the products together.  What I don't know is HOW I can accomplish this.  

I believe the way to accomplish this is to break out the orders by CustomerID, SalesDate and SalesTime.  Then, I get a `for-loop`, or something like that to cycle through the individual entries.  Then, I look for the last 4 characters of the MultOrderID and say - If 1,2 and 3 are the same, and the 4th character is after the 4th character of the previous order, then pair it together, up to 4 orders.  If the orderID is the 5th to 8th order in the range, then that's shipment 2, etc.  

Can this be done in `SQL Server`?  If not in that, what should I write this in?  And is a `for-loop` what I should be using in this case?

He is used to code in interpreted languages (AS3, PHP), which have eval functions, and I got used to use compiled languages (such as C++).
Then, I tried to explain him that, to have eval functionality in compiled languages is impossible, because native code, does not know anything about its source code (variables, syntax, reflection (in case of C/C++) and so on) and that way, you can not make any function to take source code to be executed in real time without compile (and to compile it, you need the rest of source code, so it is impossible).

What do you think? Is this argument solid enough? Will you give any other arguments to argue why a compiled language can't have eval functionality? (Please, don't post stuff for nor against eval idea).",c++,c,compilation,eval,,03/14/2012 23:55:21,off topic

When a user needs to customize this documentation, they click a special link on SharePoint to generate a new document (DOCX) from the template they choose. This new document file always needs to be ""linked"" back to its template file on SharePoint. If the document loses that link, it won’t work correctly and is considered “broken”. 

When documents break, I need to re-establish the link back to the right template on SharePoint. It makes sense to do this programmatically so I can distribute the solution to my team.

I want to give each template file a unique Template ID (a three-digit number), stored in metadata or a custom file property. When new documents are generated from the templates, the Template ID automatically carries over into the document, so that’s set. Now I just need to use VBA to scan the template files in the SharePoint document library for the matching Template ID. When that’s found, I can re-establish the link and all is well.

I’m basically looking for this:

    Sub DocFixer()

    Dim objTemplate as Template
    Dim objBrokenDoc as Document

    Set objBrokenDoc = ActiveDocument

    For each objTemplate in ""\\SharePoint\Template Library\"".Templates
        If objTemplate.Properties(""Template ID"").Value = objBrokenDoc.Properties(""Template ID"").Value Then
            objBrokenDoc.AttachedTemplate = objTemplate.Path
            Exit For
        End If
    Next

    End Sub

…but I’m having trouble using VBA to read SharePoint doc library contents without actually opening the contents, as that takes far too long with so many templates, plus its very disruptive for the user.

Any ideas? Could you point me in the right direction?

Develop an application that simulates a slot machine. The player starts out with 10 coins, each coin has the value of 50 cent. For each play, the player can bet 1 to 4 coins. If the player enters 0 as the number of coins to bet, then the game will stop. At the end of the game, the program displays the number of coins left and how much the player has won or lost in dollors. There are three slots in the machine and each slot will display one of the three possible pieces: Bell, Grape and Cherry. When certain combinations appear on the slots, the machine will pay the player. The payoff combinations are as follows:

No.	Combination	Payoff (* Betting Amount)
1	Bell	Bell	Bell	10
2	Grapes	Grapes	Grapes	7
3	Cherry	Cherry	Cherry	5
4	Cherry	Cherry	?	3
5	Cherry	?	Cherry	3
6	?	Cherry	Cherry	3
7	Cherry	?	?	1
8	?	Cherry	?	1
9	?	?	Cherry	1
 
The symbol ? means any piece. If the player bets 4 coins and gets combination 5, for example, the machine pays the player 12 coins. 

Use Object Oriented Programming principles to separate the logic and functionality of the application into separate appropriate classes and methods.

I've tried tweaking the CounterSetInstanceType in various ways with no success:

If i use Multiple or MultipleAggregate i always see a single instance in perfmon, but there is really a separate counter for each process and they overwrite each other. The same behavior happens with a Single counterset type.

Anyway my 1st question is... I'm developing this software a Web application in PHP. and i need to develop an automatic update component for that software. i have over 1 year experience in PHP. when i thought about how to develop this.. this is what came to my mind. logic - download latest version as a zip file to the server, unzip, upload and overwrite the files already existing... and if there are number of versions available: assume user is having 1.2 version and he need to update to the 1.5 newest version, system will download all the versions after 1.2 and overwrite files one by one with the files of 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 versions. this seems a big overload to the server. i really don't have another idea. I hope you all can hep me out. And i also want to know what kind of php technologies i can use for this? Help much appreciated.   ",php,version-control,curl,software-update,,,open

Of late, I've been a big fan of the [Accordion][1]. When styled and combined with some of the better animations it looks great. I've also just been introduced to the [coda-slider][2], which also does an great job.

Help me learn! List your favorite JQuery controls and plug-ins!

I have a PHP file that references two HTML files and each of those references a CSS file.  Since they are all in the same directory (bucket) when referencing everything I simply put the file name and extension.  Based on my limited knowledge I think this should work and isn't the issue, let me know if I am wrong

I have found this bit of code and edited it to suit my needs:
I have it saved in this location:

h ttp://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/changed-to-protect-appsecret/facebook.php

        <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN""
        ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"">
        <html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" xml:lang=""en"">
        <?php
        require 'facebook.php';
        $app_id = ""148002285301879"";
        $app_secret = ""myappsecret"";
        $facebook = new Facebook(array(
        'appId' => $app_id,
        'secret' => $app_secret,
        'cookie' => true
         ));

        $signed_request = $facebook->getSignedRequest();

        $page_id = $signed_request[""page""][""id""];
        $page_admin = $signed_request[""page""][""admin""];
        $like_status = $signed_request[""page""][""liked""];
        $country = $signed_request[""user""][""country""];
        $locale = $signed_request[""user""][""locale""];

        // If a fan is on your page
        if ($like_status == 1) {
        $a = file_get_contents(""fan.html"");
        echo ($a);
        } else {
        // If a non-fan is on your page
        $a = file_get_contents(""nofan.html"");
        echo ($a);
        }

        ?>

Everything above is exactly as it is except the app secret.

I then uploaded HTML files to the same bucket and named them nonfan.html and fan.html as well as a file named fb.css and various images to be used.

On my Facebook app I don't know what to put for:

Canvas URL, Secrue Canvas URL, or Page Tab URL, Secure Page Tab URL.

For both of those I used one of the following depending on weather or not it was secure.
 
h ttp://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/changed-to-protect-appsecret/facebook.php?

h ttps://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/changed-to-protect-appsecret/facebook.php?

I added the ""?"" to the end because Facebook said I need it.  I also just changed the Http to Https, not sure if that is correct.

Here is where the landing page is:
https://www.facebook.com/pages/Social-Media-Managers-Inc/120283264707317?sk=app_148002285301879

It is basically blank and I don't know what to do from here to figure out where the issue is.

Also not sure if the problem is with how I set up the facebook app or the PHP file not working properly or that the HTLM files are not being loaded.

I'm new so I have altered the links to not be hyperlinks but remove the space and they are all as is.

Any info would be appreciated!!

When I took the @UiField declaration out of the viewImpl and the ui.xml it compiled, but the widget wasn't displaying when the page loaded.  

What am I missing here?

One could try tackling this on the EF side as well (like in [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/463799/entity-framework-cancel-a-property-change-if-no-change-in-value)) but I wanted to see if AutoMapper could handle it out-of-the-box

I'm trying to figure out if AutoMapper can (easily :) compare the source and dest values (when using it to sync to an existing object) and do the copy only if the values are different (based on Equals by default, potentially passing in a Func<TSource, TDest, bool>, like if I decided to do String.Equals with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase for some particular pair of values).  At least for my scenario, I'm fine if it's restricted to just the TSource == TDest case (I'll be syncing over int's, string's, etc, so I don't think I'll need any type converters involved)

Looking through the samples and tests, the closest thing seems to be conditional mapping (src\UnitTests\ConditionalMapping.cs), and I would use the Condition overload that takes the Func<ResolutionContext, bool> (since the other overload isn't sufficient, as we need the dest information too).  That certainly looks on the surface like it would work fine (I haven't actually used it yet), but I would end up with specifying this for every member (although I'm guessing I could define a small number of actions/methods and at least reuse them instead of having N different lambdas).

Is this the simplest available route (outside of changing AutoMapper) for getting a 'only copy if source and dest values are different' or is there another way I'm not seeing?  If it *is* the simplest route, has this already been done before elsewhere?  It certainly feels like I'm likely reinventing a wheel here. :)",automapper,,,,,,open

This site will be extremely public and contain important information people assume is true, that I wouldn't want hijacked. It'd be a disaster is this site got hacked, so I started thinking of some ways to protect it, or fight back.

Everything has been made with dynamic html through PHP, except for error messages, which use javascript popup alerts triggered by PHP cookies. There are textbox forms and dropdown boxes, all encased with htmlentities to prevent code from being run.

So I started thinking, ""what are the ways that my site's security could be compromised, what weapons of choice do hackers use?"" 

- I know about changing the source code of the site with tools like firebug or chrome for themselves, but that shouldn't matter because I use PHP, and I'm more worried about what EVERYONE sees.

- They can use javascript injections, which I'm pretty sure just means manually changing javascript values, but really all that's going to do is get them an error message since that's all I use it for.

- They could submit code to execute to the forms, but like I said, htmlentities should stop that.

 - They could DDoS the site, which would crash it and to which I don't know of any defense. But I really don't think I'd be dealing with a entire faceless group of internet megaterrorists here :P Just the average hacker or script-kiddie.

 - They could change the html of email submission forms to get my password sent to me (them), but I don't use an email form, or have any logins at all on the site, everyone just sees the same thing, plus some data that optional cookies give them.

 - They could bruteforce my password for the server/ftp, but I'm really random with my passwords and it's a wonder I can even remember my 14 digit or so seemingly random string of caps, lowercase, and numbers that I call a password, so I think that that would take quite a while. Even with a program's aid. I can't think of a legit defense against that other than allowing a certain number of tries before delay.


Off the top of my head, those are the only ways I can think of that hackers do their thing. I know not only human hackers do it, there are robots that can too, or zombie computers right?


Since it is possible, but to my knowledge, extremely unlikely to my knowledge that someone could gain access to my site, I've come up with a couple possible defenses that I'm not sure if they're usually implemented or even possible. Here goes:


Scenario: A hacker manages to bruteforce my password. They get in the server and decide to take over the site and change information. The audience is unaware of anything and think everything is just going as normal. The worst case I can think of (before total deletion) is a hacker would inject a virus/trojan/malware or something into the main page, and now everyone who went there would get this thing. The hacker has won and taken over and gathered a new army of zombie computers maybe.
BUT, since the hacker is probably going to go to my main page first, I'd have another page hidden somewhere, probably deep in a folder maze, or included but burying in the source code. It would be a thing that kicks the user (myself included) out of the server unless the user visited that hidden page within 30 seconds of login. Then it changes the password and emails the new one to my email address. Also it updates the main site with ""WE'VE BEEN HACKED, BEWARE"" which won't be able to be changed without a different password that is also sent to my email along with the IP of the user. This would probably require an external program to manage, right?

Another defense in the same vein, but more dangerous, would be once the hacker is on the server, they find a file that has a list of my passwords right out in the open, possibly hidden within 1 folder. What an idiot, didn't he think one day it'd be broken into??

Well the passwords are all fake, but the first one there is information that claims to unlock things on a page it tells hacker to go to. Once there, the hacker types in that password and then gets a virus or something, along with all the rest of the stuff I mentioned earlier in the other scenario. This page would be named extremely randomly prevent people from finding it by mistake.

Another thing is, once a page is finalized and public, have some way to prevent its byte size from changing. I know some programs do this, I'm not sure how or if websites can.

Also, probably host different parts of the site on different servers. That's probably expensive though.


And most realistically of these, I'd just have a forum message board, on a different server with a different password, and I'd just announce we were hacked there.





So with that list of convolution and traps, what other ways can I protect my site from being hacked? What are all the ways (or general tactics and categories) that hackers choose to destroy or exploit sites? 
In my case, the main backbone of my site are text files that tell the PHP what to do. I just realized that thats a big hole since they could make a php file to write to the ones on my server. There's probably a way to lock txts from being written that I'm not realizing right now though. Plus they'd have to guess the variables and what everything means.

 
Are any of the things from the list of defense traps a good or possible idea?? ",php,javascript,security,website,,01/27/2012 09:08:47,not a real question

					$this->redirect('login');

	}

It first checks to see if the user is authorized in session.

If the user is authorized in session, it redirects them to the intended page.

If the user is authorized in session because they have submitted the login form, it checks to see if 'Remember Me' is selected-- then it creates a cookie, before redirecting.

If the user is not authorized in session, the function checks for the existence of the Auth.User cookie, and then attempts to Auth->login($cookie).

This is where the problem occurs.

If a user without a session, but HAS a cookie, visits the site, it redirects forever, writing to the log ""has been authenticated via cookie and is now logged IN"" over and over again until the browser terminates.

I am confused because $this->Auth->login($cookie) is returning true, but the SESSION is not being updated!

How can Auth->login($cookie) return true, but the session's auth info remain unset (causing the infinite loop)?

When watching the Cookie's in Firebug during the infinite loop, I notice that the CAKEPHP session cookie is constantly changing values during this process

I should also mention that the login system/auth/redirect etc work fine when no Auth.User cookie is present

However, one could also drop the dependencies into shared libraries, to use the same dependencies for each of the deployed artifacts.

**The question:** what are the benefits and drawbacks of each approach? In which situations would you use them?

The biggest requirement is intuitiveness/maintainability. I don't care too much about memory consumption, disk space usage, bandwith, etc. as those are cheap to buy.

Anyway, some points for each:

Including dependencies inside WAR:

  * ""De facto"" approach(?)
  * Easy to maintain (needs less configuration & scripting, etc.)
  * Easy to deploy to app server
  * Each module can define specific versions on libraries
  * Reduces risk for classloading errors?

Using shared libraries:

  * Reduced memory consumption (trivial?)
  * WAR deployments can access the same instances/variables etc. as they share the classpath? It actually sounds really bad? (does it really work that way, or are they run in separate contexts, just using the same physical files?)
  * Makes doing distributions and deployments more difficult as dependencies have to be separately maintained/deployed
  * Packages are smaller in size (trivial)
  * Dependencies can up upgraded without actual re-deployment of WAR apps (what's the benefit, really..)

Of course, we could use the best aspects of both approaches and just provide the common libraries as a shared lib, and include version specialities inside WARs. However, this doubles the maintenance effort and feels like a no-no.

Ok i think that's it.

Im trying to follow the hibernate contextual sessions implementation according to the book Spring in Action: Third Edition, and my code seems to be fairly right, when i start jboss hibernate reports the mapping doing just fine, my db is a datasource configured on jboss AS7 standalone.xml with the correct information.

Here is an example of what the jboss log returns when starting my app:

Setup went fairly well with the NameNode (1 machine), SecondaryNameNode (1) and all DataNodes (3). The machines are named ""master"", ""secondary"" and ""data01"", ""data02"" and ""data03"". All DNS are properly set up, and passwordless SSH was configured from master/secondary to all machines and back. 

I formatted the cluster with `bin/hadoop namenode -format`, and then started all services using `bin/`tart-all.sh`. All processes on all nodes were checked to be up and running with `jps`. My basic configuration files look something like this:

I'm just trying to get HDFS running properly now.

I've created a dir for testing `hadoop fs -mkdir testing`, then tried to copy some files into it with `hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /tmp/*.txt testing`. This is when hadoop crashes, giving me more or less this:

    WARN hdfs.DFSClient: DataStreamer Exception: org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: java.io.IOException: File /user/hd/testing/wordcount1.txt could only be replicated to 0 nodes, instead of 1
      at ... (such and such)

      at ...

And so on. A similar issue occurs when I try to run `hadoop fs -lsr .` from a DataNode machine, only to get the following:

    12/01/02 10:02:11 INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connt to server master/192.162.10.10:9000. Already tried 0 time(s).

    12/01/02 10:02:13 INFO ipc.Client: Retrying connt to server master/192.162.10.10:9000. Already tried 2 time(s).
    ...

I'm saying it's similar, because I suspect this is a port availability issue. Running `telnet master 9000` reveals that the port is closed. I've read somewhere that this might be an IPv6 clash issue, and thus defined the following in conf/hadoop-env.sh:

    export HADOOP_OPTS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true

But that didn't do the trick. Running `netstat` on the master reveals something like this:

    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address       Foreign Address      State
    tcp        0      0  localhost:9000      localhost:56387      ESTABLISHED
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56386     localhost:9000       TIME_WAIT
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56387     localhost:9000       ESTABLISHED
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56384     localhost:9000       TIME_WAIT
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56385     localhost:9000       TIME_WAIT
    tcp        0      0  localhost:56383     localhost:9000       TIME_WAIT

At this point I'm pretty sure the problem is with the port (9000), but I'm not sure what I missed as far as configuration goes. Any ideas? Thanks.

I have an `ArrayList` of `Book`s pulled from different `Merchant`s and sorted in Java, depending on user preferences, according to price or customer reviews:

    List<Book> books = new ArrayList<Book>();

This requires me to keep a large chunk of data in memory stored as Java objects at all times. Now that I need to paginate this data into listings that span multiple web pages and allow a user to click on a numbered page link to hop to that segment of the data, what's the best way to do this?

My idea was to have maybe **25 book listings per page** and rather than use hyperlinks that submit the form data as a `GET` request of URL parameters, **the page number hyperlinks would simply resubmit the form**, passing the requested page number as an additional form `POST` parameter.

    <input type=""hidden"" id=""pageNumber"" value=""0"">
    <a href=""#"" onClick=""pageNumber=5; this.form.submit()"">Page 5</a>

In that case page 5 would simply be a set of 25 records starting at the 125th (5 * 25) record in the `ArrayList` and ending at the 149th record in the `ArrayList`.

Because it can give out a more detail information compared to javac.

In my startup configuration.
I use ""make"" to help me compile my program
so I have to set the compiler for ""make"" first

I use this command to set the compiler to gcc automatically when the filetype is java.
**autocmd FileType java compiler gcc**

But when I　tried to compile my program using ""make""
It give out a lot of message that I don't understand,
and it cannot compile the program.

However, 
When I first set the compiler to javac,then set it to gcc later.
""make"" works!!

 1. In my startup config : **autocmd FileType java compiler javac**
 2. When i am editing the file, **:compiler gcc**

Then I can compile my java program using make with gcc compiler

I don't know what the problem it is.
Can I automatically set compiler to gcc instead of setting it later when editing the file ??
